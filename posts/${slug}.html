<h1>From the Bottom to the Build: How Christ, Code, and Chaos Created VibeCode</h1>
<p>I had a pretty normal upbringing — at least on the surface. I grew up on a farm 10 miles outside a small town, feeling isolated and misunderstood. School was a struggle. I didn’t quite fit in, and life felt more like surviving than thriving.</p>
<p>In 2010, fueled by nothing but dreams and stolen gas, I hit the road from Jamestown, North Dakota with my cousin and best friend Zack. We slept outside the Empire State Building in NYC, made it to Daytona Beach, Florida, and eventually wound up in Mississippi. The mission? Circle the coast.</p>
<p>But life had other plans. My grandfather passed away, and we had to head back home. We planned to continue the journey later, but something happened on that trip that changed everything.</p>
<p>That’s when I found meth — or maybe, when meth found me.</p>
<p>I had tried just about every substance before, but this one was different. I fell in love. That false love would go on to cost me 16 incarcerations and 4 years of homelessness. I lost myself, my identity, my direction. But I never fully lost faith.</p>
<p>On August 9th, 2023, I checked into a hotel planning to throw a wild party. But instead, something miraculous happened. I laid down... and fell into the deepest sleep I’ve ever known. When I woke up, I felt something indescribable.</p>
<p>God’s love.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a feeling — it was a presence. Overwhelming, warm, holy. I wept. Not from pain... but from joy. It was the first time I had cried happy tears in years.</p>
<p>Exactly one year later, on August 9th, 2024, I was released from a one-year sentence in county jail. (15 days day-for-day, then good time — jail math.) I was free.</p>
<p>I hit the pavement hard, putting in 20–30 job applications a week. A few interviews. No bites. It was discouraging. But I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit — and God didn’t bring me this far to leave me hanging.</p>
<p>So I started my own company!</p>
<p>It began with a retail phone store. I landed partnerships with Dish Wireless, Apple, and a few others. But customers weren’t coming. I could’ve sat around and waited, but that’s not who I am.</p>
<p>I turned to this thing everyone’s talking about: <strong>AI</strong>.</p>
<p>And that’s when <strong>VibeCode</strong> was born.</p>
<p>VibeCode lets anyone, anywhere prompt an AI and build a fully functional iOS, Android, or web app — instantly. No dev team. No coding degree. Just a dream.</p>
<p>I posted a few teasers on LinkedIn and Reddit… and boom. I caught the attention of some amazing investors. Now? I have a <strong>full-stack Fortune 500 company</strong> partnering with me to develop this vision — and I’m leading it.</p>
<p>I’m sharing this because someone out there needs to hear it. I was the underdog. I was the addict. I was the forgotten one.</p>
<p>But through <strong>Christ</strong>, I’ve hit a turning point.</p>
<p>And I believe <strong>His divine Spirit can take anything — even ashes — and turn it into something beautiful</strong>.</p>
