I had a pretty normal up-brining, although i felt isolated. living on a farm 10 miles
outside a small town. i struggles in school. In 2010 after taking a road trip on
stolen gas from Jamestown North Dakota to NYC (where me my cousin and best
friend Zack slept outside the empire state building) we made it down to Daytona
Beach Florida and eventually Missisippi. Our main mission was to make it all
around the coast but my grandfather had passed and we needed to head home
to the funeral. We had plans to go back but on our trip I found meth for the first
time. I had tried nearly all substances in the past but something was different
about this one. I fell in love. 16 incarcerations later and 4 years of homelessness
I refound Christ.
I for some reason decided I would go to a hotel for the night. I was planning on
having a huge sex party but as soon i checked in I layed down and fell into a
deep deep sleep. When I woke up I felt God's love entertangle me it was (the
only word I can think of describing it) overwhelming.. I wept and wept and it
wasnt a bad cry it was a happy cry. That was August 9th 2023. Exactly a year
later I was released from a one year sentence in county jail August 9th 2024 (6
months county time, first 15 days are day for day and then you do half your
sentence on good time). When i was released I looked for months and months
for work and had no luck (putting 20-30 applications in a week) a few interviews..
nothing. So always knowing i have an entreprenereal spirit I went to start my own
company.
I started a retail phone store and after 3 months of sucesfully getting partnerships
with Dish wireless, Apple, and a few other companies. The customers just werent
coming. I am not someone who just likes to sit around so I started checking out
this AI everyone is talking about. and that is what birthed VibeCode. Viobecode
allows you to prompt an AI and it will build a fully functional iOS, android, or web
app for you. I posted a few teasers on Likedin and Reddit and caught the eye of
some amazing investors. I now have a full stack fortune 500 company working on
processing and developing this application with me in charge!!
I wanted to share this with you in hopes that you will read it, i was also the
underdog my whole life but through Christ I believe I have hit a turning point and
His devine spirit can turn anything into something amazing!!
